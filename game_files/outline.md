# Outline

## In the beginning...

The player starts on a dark road in the middle of a forest. They see the north star ahead of them and they can choose to walk north or south. If they walk south, they are eaten by monsters. If they go north, they will come across an old decrepit Victorian style mansion.

## At the mansion...

If the player enters the mansion, they will hear a spooky voice emanate from the walls. It tells the player that an ancient family was trapped within the walls by an evil sorcerer and that the only way to free them from their imprisonment is to collect certain keepsakes and return them to their proper locations.
